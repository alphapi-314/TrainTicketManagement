Project Title:

"Priority-Based Railway Booking System Using Greedy Algorithm"


Project Overview:

This project introduces a smart railway ticket booking system that uses a Greedy algorithm to improve seat allocation and enhance the passenger experience. Traditional booking platforms do not prioritize passenger needs such as lower berths for elderly travelers or group seating arrangements. To address these limitations, this system implements a preference-aware booking logic that efficiently manages seat distribution based on age, group membership, preferred berth, and booking time.

Technology Stack and System Architecture

The application is developed using Java and Spring Boot for backend services, while the frontend is built using HTML, CSS, and Thymeleaf to provide a user-friendly interface. MongoDB is used as the database to persist passenger and ticket information. Core functionalities are exposed through RESTful APIs, and seamless integration between frontend and backend ensures a smooth user experience. The seat allocation logic, powered by a Greedy algorithm, dynamically assigns seats to maximize user satisfaction and optimize seat usage.

Tasks Completed:

The team has successfully implemented user registration and login modules, ticket booking and viewing functionality, and backend services for cancellation, rescheduling, and seat class upgrades. The frontend and backend are fully integrated, and the Greedy algorithm has been developed to handle smart seat allocation. Testing for all major features has been completed and validated.

Challenges Faced:

Several technical and design challenges were encountered during development. Implementing complex booking logic, especially the waitlist update mechanism after cancellations, required in-depth team discussions and research. Database integration using MongoDB with Spring Boot posed initial difficulties, which were resolved through tutorials and step-by-step testing. Designing an intuitive and responsive UI also required significant effort, and error handling�such as displaying accurate messages for invalid inputs�was another key area that demanded careful attention.

Future Enhancements:
The project roadmap includes several planned improvements. These include integration of a payment gateway and implementation of OTP-based authentication for enhanced security. The team also plans to introduce live train tracking using location APIs and to develop an analytics dashboard for administrators. Additional features such as user feedback, rating systems, better mobile responsiveness, and multi-language support are also in the pipeline to broaden the system's accessibility and user satisfaction.

Project Deliverables:

The key deliverable is a fully operational Railway Ticket Management System with complete frontend and backend functionality. Major components include a responsive user interface, REST APIs for ticket operations, MongoDB integration for data management, and Greedy algorithm-based smart seat allocation. The system is capable of managing the full ticket lifecycle�booking, viewing, cancelling, rescheduling, and upgrading.

Conclusion:

The Priority-Based Railway Booking System is a successful implementation of Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA) principles in a real-world application. With all planned features implemented and tested, the system is deployment-ready. It significantly improves the traditional booking experience by incorporating logic that prioritizes passenger needs while ensuring efficient seat usage.
